This is the source code of the Jekyll theme for my personal blog at [hardyscheel.de](https://hardyscheel.de) hosted at GitHub Pages. Based on a Jekyll template [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) which then got many extensions by me.

*Cayman is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. You can [preview the theme to see what it looks like](http://pages-themes.github.io/cayman).
